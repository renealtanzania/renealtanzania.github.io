    Please wait while shutting down the bond0 interface.

I have found 3 network interfaces.
    Ethernet interfaces: 3

This interface was found active:  name: usb0, macaddress: a0:ce:c8:b9:60:45 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please unplug all cables.
    Hit enter when you have done this.
>>>
Try again?
  yes / no

Please type "yes" or "no"
yes

The ethernet interfaces will need to be identified by plugging each ethernet 
interface to an ethernet cable that is connected to either an ethernet switch 
or another computer that is turned on. 
The test is only used to detect power on the ethernet connection port so the 
switch does not need to be connected to anything else or the other computer 
just needs to be turned on.
Do you have these things available now?
  yes / no
yes


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To identify the correct interface for the internet plug in the cable to the 
ethernet interface on the computer motherboard. This is the one just above 
all of the small plugs for the audio. 
If there is more than one ethernet interface on the motherboard, just pick one.
    Hit enter when you have done this.
>>>

No plugin found. Please plug in the ethernet cable to an interface.
Try again?
  yes / no
yes

OK, now unplug the cable.
    Hit enter when you have done this.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now identify the ethernet interface that will be "lab1", the first ethernet
that will be connected to the switch for use inside the lab. If the interface cards
have only a single connection, use the top card. If there is a two ethernet 
connection interface card, use the left connection.
    Hit enter when you have done this.

The remaining interface has been automatically configured as lab2.

    Now you can connect the Reneal wireless router to the LAN connection on the USB dongle.    
    Next, connect the cables from the LAN connection on the computer to the network switch.
    
    Finally, reboot the server and you will be ready to go.
